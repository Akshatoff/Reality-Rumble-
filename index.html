                <li class="list-item"><strong>Choose A Path</strong> -: Start by picking your career path: college, trade, or entrepreneurship. Each path comes with its own Career and Education cards, shaping the twists and turns of your journey.</li>
                <li class="list-item"><strong>Life Happens</strong> -: As you go, you'll draw Event and Opportunity cards. These represent unexpected moments—like a chance to pick up a new skill or start a side hustle—that can boost your Wealth, Happiness, or Legacy.</li>
                <li class="list-item"><strong>Make Your Move</strong> -:Every turn, you get Action Points to spend on life choices. Invest in education, build relationships, or focus on your health. Each choice matters, adding depth to the decisions you make.
                </li>
                <li class="list-item"><strong>Define Your Own Success</strong> -: Winning isn’t just about having the most money. Track three metrics: Wealth, Happiness, and Legacy. Whoever scores highest across all three is the winner, proving that life isn’t one-size-fits-all.</li>
                <li class="list-item"><strong>Set Personal Goals</strong> -:Everyone starts with unique personal goals, like having a happy family, excelling in your career, or giving back to the community. Achieving these goals gives you extra Happiness and Legacy points.</li>
                <li class="list-item"><strong>Financial Risks and Rewards</strong> -:You’ll make big financial decisions—buying properties, taking out loans, or starting businesses. But beware, markets change, and sometimes risks don’t pay off!</li>
                <li class="list-item"><strong>Choose Your Life Path</strong> -:   With Life Path cards, you can decide where to focus—career, relationships, or health. Each path comes with its own rewards and challenges, making each player’s journey different.
                </li>
                <li class="list-item"><strong>End on Your Terms</strong> -: The game ends when you reach a certain level in two of the three success metrics. The player with the highest overall score wins, showing that in life, success is about balance, not just hitting a finish line.
